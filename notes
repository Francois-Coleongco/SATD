for ui:

detections feed
active connections


for docker:

three containers. one for auth, one for server, and one for agent (can spawn multiple docker instances for the agent to simulate multiple systems)

generate certificates for both server and auth service using openssl

this is just for demonstration. obviously you would use certs that are compliant with an authority etc etc but i don't gots money so


install golang
install grpc/proto dependencies

go mod tidy it all up
build agents
